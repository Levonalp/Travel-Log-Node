Welcome to the Travel Log App! This app is designed to help you keep track of all your travels. With this app, you can create, read, update and delete your travel logs. 

To get started, you will need to install the following packages: 
- Express 
- Mongoose 
- Cors 

Once these packages are installed, you can begin using the app. You can use the `app.get()` method to retrieve all your travels from the database. You can also use `app.post()` to create a new travel log in the database. If you want to update or delete an existing travel log, you can use `app.put()` and `app.delete()`. Finally, don't forget to connect your app with MongoDB using `mongoose.connect()`. 

Now that everything is set up, it's time for you to start tracking your travels!
